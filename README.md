## Introduction
In this paper, we take a new perspective that aims to leverage rich user-item interaction data (user interaction data for short) for improving the KGC task. Our work is inspired by the observation that many KG entities correspond to online items in application systems.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.6
- Pytorch >= 1.0

## Dataset
We provide three processed datasets in : Movielens, Last-FM, and Amazon-book.
* You can find the full version of recommendation datasets via [Movielens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), [Last-FM](http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-1b/), [Amazon-book](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon).
* The linkage used in this dataset is from [KB4Rec](https://github.com/RUCDM/KB4Rec).

| | | Movie | Music | Book |
|:---:|:---|---:|---:|---:|
|| #Users | 61,859 | 57,976 | 75,639|
|User Interaction| #Items | 17,568 | 55,431 | 22,072|
| | #Interactions | 9,908,778 | 2,605,262 | 831,130|
|| #Entities | 56,789 | 108,930 | 79,682|
|Knowledge Graph | #Relations | 47 | 45 | 38 |
| | #Triplets | 953,598 | 914,842 | 400,787|

Each dataset is organized with following structure:
- `data-name/`
  - `rs/`
    - `u_map.dat`: user id mapping file;
    - `i_map.dat`: item id mapping file;
    - `i2kg_map.tsv`: mapping from original item id to freebase entity;
    - `ratings.txt`: raw rating file of dataset.
  - `kg/`
    - `e_map.dat`: entity id mapping file;
    - `r_map.dat`: relation id mapping file;
    - `train.dat`: mapped triples of train set;
    - `valid.dat`: mapped triples of validation set;
    - `test.dat`: mapped triples of test set.
    
## Training Instruction
