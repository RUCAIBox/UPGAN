# UPGAN (User Preference enhanced GAN)

This is our Pytorch implementation for the paper:

> Gaole He, Junyi Li, Wayne Xin Zhao, Peiju Liu and Ji-Rong Wen (2020). Mining Implicit Entity Preference from User-Item Interaction Data for Knowledge Graph Completion via Adversarial Learning. [Paper in arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12718). In WWW'2020, Taipei, Taiwan, China, April 20â€“24, 2020.


## Introduction
In this paper, we take a new perspective that aims to leverage rich user-item interaction data (user interaction data for short) for improving the KGC task. Our work is inspired by the observation that many KG entities correspond to online items in application systems.

# Requirements:

- Python 3.6
- Pytorch >= 1.0
